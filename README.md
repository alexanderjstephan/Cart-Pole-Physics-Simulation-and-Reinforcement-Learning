# Cart-Pole-Physics-Simulation-and-Reinforcement-Learning

## Overview
This project simulates the classic cart pole game using accurate physics concepts. From there, the simulation is given to a reinforcement learning agent to learn how to play the game.

## Results
Reinforcement learning agent significantly outperformed human attempt at playing the game. Model was limited by the model's nonconsideration of the boundaries.
